This repository contains an R implementation of:

> the inflated Rayleigh seasonal autoregressive moving average model with exogenous regressors (iRSARMAX) called irarma function,
> the sample generator from inflated Rayleigh autoregressive moving average model called sample.irarma function, and
> the selection model algorithm to iRSARMAX model, called auto.irarma function.
For an application example, please open the file "example.R".

If you have any problem, please contact Aline Armanini Stefanan (aline.armanini@acad.ufsm.br).
